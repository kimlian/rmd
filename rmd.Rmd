## R Markdown

my name is kim. This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Diamonds, Price versus Carat

The following plot shows carat versus price.

```{r diamonds}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(carat,price,data=diamonds)
```

## Diamonds, Price/Carat versus Carat

The following plot shows carat versus price/carat.

```{r diamondspc}
qplot(carat,price/carat,data=diamonds)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated t## Diamonds, Price versus Carat

The following plot shows carat versus price.

```{r diamondslog}
qplot(log(carat),log(price),data=diamonds)
```

```{r diamondscolor}
qplot(carat,price,data=diamonds,colour=color)
```
